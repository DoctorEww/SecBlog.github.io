## Hello There

My name is Drew Griess and I wanted to have a place to give back and share what I have learned to the cyber community. 

Right now, there is not much to see here... I mean, this is just a test of my blog's posting system. For this blog I used the template [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) ~~to get out of the web development part of this project~~ because it looks really cool. 

In the future there might be bug bounties, ctf writeups, random research, and more. For now, its just this pointless page.
