Thus, I created this blog.Right now, there is not much to see here… I mean, this is just a test of my blog’s posting system. For this blog I used the template Chirpy to get out of the web development part of this project because it looks really cool.In the future there might be bug bounties, ctf writeups, random research, and more. For now, its just this pointless page." } ]
