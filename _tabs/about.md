My name is Drew Griess and I created this blog so that I could share what I am working on and give back some of the cybersecurity skills I have learned. This blog might have CTF writeups, security research, bug bounties, or maybe ill forget about it. My favorite CTF catagories are misc, crypto, and web.

If you want to get in contact please message me on twitter I would love to hack your stuff or hack something with you. If you want to keep updated with what I am up too, feel free to [follow me](https://twitter.com/griessdrew).
